# Parallel-Cellular-Automata
Serial and parallel Elementary Cellular Autometa (ECA) is implemented with MPI. This is a good practice and introduction to do some synchronous computing.

It should be noted that in the written code, each processor is working on its own part of CA and at the end of processing, the results are stacked together for creating the final CA figure.
